# mini-fintech-application
This is a mini fintech application that could be used to send money albeit to my own Bank Account. So please dont send any money. The UI was rebuilt with Paga's UI with some changes. Paga is one of the largest fintechs in Nigeria. The Payment App itself makes use of Paystack API. 

Use 'kronika' as a username to access the payment page. This project was a great way for me to sharpen my CSS skills and really get into asyn Javascript.
